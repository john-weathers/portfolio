              Computer science student with hands-on experience (2 years) in full-stack development and object-oriented programming,
              using multiple languages. I am making a career transition after discovering an untapped passion and aptitude for
              programming. I believe I can show, through my prior experience, transferrable skills, and references, that I already have a
              strong track record of being a positive contributor to organizations as a full-time professional and would make an excellent
              team member.

              Prior to being a developer I worked in both the legal and blockchain industries â€“ my experience in these positions adds to my value as a software developer. 
              The legal field is incredibly logic and detail focused where you must be well-versed in research/analysis/reading (legal) documentation. 
              You must also be accustomed to working under immense pressure with tight deadlines. 
              The blockchain industry requires a self-starter who can thrive no matter what, even when guidance is minimal and waters are uncharted.
