              I am a highly motivated computer science student looking for a software engineering internship. As a career changer, 
              I believe I can bring a more diverse perspective than the average undergraduate student. 
              Furthermore, I already have a track record of making positive contributions to organizations. 
              I discovered my passion for programming in 2022 and have now been programming for one and a half years. 
              I hope to be a value add as a SWE intern while I continue to build my skill set as a developer.

              Prior to being a developer I worked in both the legal and blockchain industries â€“ my experience in these positions adds to my value as a software developer. 
              The legal field is incredibly logic and detail focused where you must be well-versed in research/analysis/reading (legal) documentation. 
              You must also be accustomed to working under immense pressure with tight deadlines. 
              The blockchain industry requires a self-starter who can thrive no matter what, even when guidance is minimal and waters are uncharted.
