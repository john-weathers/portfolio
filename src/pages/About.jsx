              I am a highly motivated web developer looking for an entry-level/junior position with growth potential. 
              I have experience both in the front end and back end, so I am open to roles focusing on any part of the stack. Please see the projects 
              section of this website for some examples of work I've done.

              Prior to being a developer I worked in both the legal and blockchain industries â€“ my experience in these positions add to my value as a software developer. 
              The legal field is incredibly logic and detail focused where you must be well-versed in research/analysis/reading (legal) documentation. 
              You must also be accustomed to working under immense pressure with tight deadlines. 
              The blockchain industry requires a self-starter who can thrive no matter what, even when guidance is minimal and waters are uncharted.
